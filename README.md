### What I learned

Working on this project helped me improve my skills in creating responsive layouts and managing design across different screen sizes. Here's a quick code snippet for centering the content using Flexbox:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
